# Take skore for a test drive!

## Intro

This repository is here to help you test and provide feedback on [skore](https://github.com/probabl-ai/skore), a new Python library that aims to enhance scikit-learn for data scientists.

Skore is developed by the product team at [Probabl](https://probabl.ai/), a scikit-learn company. For more info, check us out: [Notion page](https://probabl.notion.site/Get-to-know-Probabl-127ef76d36b9804d8ca8e264e42f0cee).

## Agenda

In total, this test drive should last under an hour.

1. Presentation of Probabl and skore: ~5 min
1. Environment setup: ~5 min
1. User testing tasks: ~35 min
    - Here is a notebook to get you started: `compare_models.ipynb`.
1. Feedback Q&A: ~15 min

### Set-up: create your virtual environment

1. Clone this GitHub repository locally.
1. Create a Python virtual environment with your usual method (conda, virtualenv...), with `python>=3.9`.
1. Install the libraries in `requirements.txt` with:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Goal of the test

The goal is to build a couple of models, and to compare them, using [skore](https://github.com/probabl-ai/skore) when relevant.

Resources:
- Notebook: `compare_models.ipynb`
